Name: Derek Haas


Timing on NVIDIA GPU:

	Load time: 98577
	Convolve time: 48750
	Copy time: 25686
	Combine time: 57572
	Store time: 113865
	Total time = 572338

Timing on Intel-optimized CPU:

	Load time: 162709
	Convolve time: 36959
	Copy time: 33381
	Combine time: 43344
	Store time: 115730
	Total time = 848900

Timing on portable POCL driver:

	Load time: 165319
	Convolve time: 63814
	Copy time: 39480
	Combine time: 76645
	Store time: 133061
	Total time = 594633

Timing of your CUDA code:

	Load time: 120402
	Copy host to device: 6053
	Convolve time: 204218
	Combine time: 7
	Copy device to host: 108422
	Store time: 113145
	Total time = 546208

Question:  Which ran faster and why?

The CUDA code ran the fastest.  This is because CUDA is optimized for NVIDIA while OpenCL is not.
Since CUDA is only for NVIDIA, its code must run faster than OpenCL since OpenCL can handle different
GPUs.
