4.
	fine_timing results:

	Load time: 99555
	Copy host to device: 5924
	Convolve time: 188182 
	Combine time: 9
	Copy device to host: 106196
	Store time: 115358	
	Total time: 509320


	Which was faster, CPU or GPU?

	The GPU was significantly faster than the CPU.  The total time the space station
	convolution took using OpenMP at 16 threads was 789ms while the GPU only took
	509320us.  The convolution was a little slower on the GPU at 188182us while the 
	convolution time on the CPU was 105977us.  However, the combine time on the GPU 
	was a lot faster.  The combine time on the GPU was 9us while it was 549668us on
	the CPU.

	Overall, the GPU was faster than the CPU.
