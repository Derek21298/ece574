Name: Derek Haas

3.

	m5dsum for both butterfinger and space station do not match.
	Butterfinger looks correct (maybe 1 line is off??)
	space station is convolved but is slanted.

	Results (time, speedup, parallel efficiency)

	1: 	Load time: 0.105018
		Convolve time: 1.158595
		Combine time: 0.267453
		Store time: 0.088438
		Total time: 1.1619503

		Speedup: N/A
		Parallel Efficency: N/A

	2: 	Load time: 0.127404
		Convolve time: 0.643259
		Combine time: 0.310389
		Store time: 0.088639
		Total time: 1.169691
	
		Speedup: 1.1619503 / 1.169691 = 0.99338
		Parallel Efficency: 0.99338 / 2 = 0.49669
	
	4: 	Load time: 0.110547
		Convolve time: 0.298662
		Combine time: 0.359182
		Store time: 0.111414
		Total time: 0.879806
	
		Speedup: 1.1619503 / 0.879806 = 1.32069
		Parallel Efficency: 1.32069 / 4 = 0.330172
	
	8: 	Load time: 0.099646
		Convolve time: 0.189946
		Combine time: 0.355407
		Store time: 0.114859
		Total time: 0.759858
	
		Speedup: 1.1619503 / 0.759858 = 1.529167
		Parallel Efficency: 1.529167 / 8 = 0.191146
	
	16: 	Load time: 0.167708
		Convolve time: 0.187403
		Combine time: 0.503284
		Store time: 0.115374
		Total time: 0.973769
			
		Speedup: 1.1619503 / 0.973769 = 1.19325
		Parallel Efficency: 1.19325 / 16 = 0.074578
